# OutOfTime
We're all out. Let's do some scraping and some planning.

This project ultimately aims to be a tool to make registering for courses and arranging a schedule convenient for students at William and Mary. It will do the following:
- scrape from the publicly viewable William and Mary Open Course List and Banner services and reconstruct a database of courses from that information.
- provide an interface for searching and selection of courses, more flexible, specific, and user-friendly than the search tools of Banner / OCL.
- automatically generate partial or complete schedules based off selected requirements and desired attributes
- suggest alternative classes and schedules that fulfill specified requirements
- display selected courses on a clear, visually compelling weekly schedule, point out conflicts and potential issues
- physically map class locations, plan daily routes through campus, and allow filtering of classes based on proximity of meeting locations over the time between them
